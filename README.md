<h1>Phishing Xplainable</h1>

<p>This software is the project for my Master's thesis.</p>
<p>It is an explainable by design model for phishing detection.
    It is trained on two datasets, the SpamAssassin dataset (for legitimate emails)
    and the Enron dataset (for phishing + legitimate mails).
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<div>
First of all, the preprocess.py script has to be run to compute the features from the two datasets
<br>
The process requires a lot of time, so just hold on...
